Copy '_vimrc' and '_vim' into your home directory and rename them to '.vimrc'
and '.vim' respectively. The config should work as-is in vim 7.4 or later.

_vim/colors/mopkai.vim is a very slightly modified version of the original
mopkai.vim colorscheme. I got it at https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes.git
